<p><em>Difficulty: 2/10</em></p>

<p>A short masterpiece that introduces the versatility of the new PS5 controller. Easter eggs that cover from classic PS titles such as FF7 and MGS to newer ones. Time attack stages are also fun to play without stressing out players. A great start for your PS5 playing and it is highly recommended for everyone.</p>

<p>Somehow I found this game pretty confusing without a guide the first time I tried to play it. There are houses everywhere but which one shall I enter first? Some of them are not even interactable. My confusion continued until I learned that quick-reloading the game will bring you to the next level immediately. However, once enter the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù house, the gameplay experience is much better. Game designers state that they implemented AI to control NPCs‚Äô actions, but those NPCs may still act stupidly which is fun to tease them a bit.</p>

<p>It took me about 2 months to obtain the plat trophy but I feel worth it to do so. It is already 4.6 so I would expect that the Spiral Abyss would be harder than before, but with Neuvillette and Arlecchino it is not that hard to beat 12F. Overall it is not a bad game, though other than the main and side quests it might be frustrating when collecting Oculi and Chests.</p>

<p>+ Side quests and areas that are fun to play, such as the Chasm (underground) and Tsurumi Island</p>

<p>- Only 4 event wishes in one month, which means that you may wait more than a year to pull your fav characters</p>

<p>- Collectable runs are frustrating, and other than collectables there‚Äôs nothing much you could interact with the world after finishing all main and side quests</p>

<p>- Artifact farming is also horrible</p>

<h2 id="214---cat-quest">#214 - Cat Quest</h2>
<p><em>Difficulty: 4/10</em></p>

<p>As an indie game, the actional gameplay and combination of magic and melee attacks make it simple to handle but also fun to play, reminding me of the Mana series a little bit.</p>

<p>+ Amazing music</p>

<p>+ Exciting boss battles, although overall the game is not difficult</p>

<p>- The healing magic does not heal that much</p>

<p>- It would be better if there were more categories of melee weapons to choose from (such as bows and lances)</p>

<h2 id="215---cat-quest-ii">#215 - Cat Quest II</h2>
<p><em>Difficulty: 3/10</em></p>

<p>This game is more like an expansion than a sequel. Other than the new weapon system, I have nothing to comment on.</p>

<h2 id="216---horizon-forbidden-west">#216 - Horizon Forbidden West</h2>
<p><em>Difficulty: 4/10</em></p>

<p>When game development of open-world games morphs into assembly lines, the development procedure will become an insoluble dilemma between designing contents delicately but with a much longer time allocated, and fully stuffing replaceable contents such as cliche minigames and tedious side quests to save time for developing. Unfortunately, this game fills into the last category.</p>

<p>+ Extensive melee combo system, although 90% of the time you will never use it</p>

<p>+ Cauldron exploration</p>

<p>- Mini-games such as Machine Strike force you to watch a video guide</p>

<p>- Blue objects for the grappling hook blend into the environment, which is hard to detect for tritanomaly players like me</p>
