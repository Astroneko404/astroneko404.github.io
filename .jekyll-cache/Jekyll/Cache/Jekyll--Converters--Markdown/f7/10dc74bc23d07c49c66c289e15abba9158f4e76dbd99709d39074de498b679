<ol>
  <li>Pay attention to your Visual Studio version:</li>
</ol>

<p>| Unreal Engine Version | Visual Studio Version |
|———————–|———————–|

  <li>While installing Visual Studio, make sure to check the “Game development with C++”, which includes C++ profiling tools and other toolkits.</li>
  <li>If anything above is missing, after copying the “Plugins” folder from the CRIWARE folder to your project folder, you may see following error message after rebuilding modules in your project:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>YourProject could not be compiled. Try rebuilding from source manually.
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>
