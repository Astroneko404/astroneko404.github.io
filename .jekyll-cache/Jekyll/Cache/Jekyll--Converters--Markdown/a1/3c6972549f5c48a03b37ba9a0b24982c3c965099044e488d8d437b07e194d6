I"’<p>The purpose of this note is a reminder that denotes several key points during importing ADX2 to Unreal Engine 4.</p>

<ol>
<li> Pay attention to your Visual Studio version:

| Unreal Engine Version | Visual Studio Version |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 4.25 or Later         | VS 2019 (Default)     |
| 4.22 or Later         | VS 2017 / VS 2019     |
| 4.15 or Later         | VS 2017               |
| 4.10 to 4.14          | VS 2015               |
| 4.2 to 4.9            | VS 2013               |

<li> While installing Visual Studio, make sure to check the "Game development with C++", which includes C++ profiling tools and other toolkits.
<li> If anything above is missing, after copying the "Plugins" folder from the CRIWARE folder to your project folder, you may see following error message after rebuilding modules in your project:
```
YourProject could not be compiled. Try rebuilding from source manually.
```
&lt;/ol&gt;
