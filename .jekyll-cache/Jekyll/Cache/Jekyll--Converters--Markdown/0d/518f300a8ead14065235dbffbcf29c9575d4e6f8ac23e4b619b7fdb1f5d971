I"<p>Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm is a key finding algorithm based on pitch class distribution, that calculates the correlation between the pitch class distribution vector, and each of the 12 major and 12 minor profile vectors.</p>

<p>The full Python code could be found on <a href="https://gist.github.com/Astroneko404/1dcde11576e510e964882bbbafaeb050" target="_blank">my GH Gist</a>.</p>
