<h2 id="221---silent-hill-2-remake">#221 - Silent Hill 2 (Remake)</h2>
<p><em>Difficulty: 2/10</em></p>

<p>I bet that in 10 months, a new Silent Hill Pachislot arcade with new graphics will be released in Japan. ü§£</p>

<p>Anyway, it is a proper remake of the OG with gorgeous graphics and a more realistic horror experience. Overall it is within my expectations, although some parts are not as adorable as in OG.</p>

<p>+ Most of the characters‚Äô dialogues and cutscenes are well restored to the OG‚Äôs taste</p>

<p>+ The Brookhaven Hospital is the best part of the game, with decent puzzles and the success in creating a disturbing atmosphere</p>

<p>+ Maria‚Äôs AI. Mostly she‚Äôll stay behind James, being much better than the OG</p>

<p>+ The high-contrast mode is a life-saver when fighting Eddie</p>

<p>- The volume of background music is too low (compared to character voices and sound effects) that almost cannot be heard on my TV, while James sounds overhyped when attacking enemies</p>

<p>- Some newly arranged music lacks the lo-fi and abstract taste compared to the OG‚Äôs arrangement, such as Magdalene and Fermata in Mistic Air. Those old ones bring suffocation and make it hard to breathe when listening to them</p>

<p>- Maria is supposed to be seductive. However, she even looks horrible than the render in the OG intro</p>

<p>- And Angela also</p>

<p>- The Labyrinth is a little bit lengthy and tedious when combined with the Daddy‚Äôs boss fight</p>

<p>- No special credit video for Dog Ending</p>

<h2 id="222---dungeon-encounters">#222 - Dungeon Encounters</h2>
<p><em>Difficulty: 2/10 (With a guide)</em></p>

<p>This game may be the best explanation of why graphics should be important for a game. The low-budget UI design somehow does not match its extraordinary gameplay experience.</p>

<p>The dungeon exploring reminds me of Wizardry and Etrian Odyssey but in a 3rd-person view. Ability points and character PP must be utilized wisely, or it may lead to a party wipe. After the party wipe, the only way to pick up KO-ed teammates is to walk your new team to a specific map coordinate, which might bring more trouble.</p>

<p>Most exploration and battle abilities would reduce the difficulty and bring surprises, such as Descend and Ascend, which allow players to obtain powerful equipment and new abilities without going down level by level. I followed a guide that allowed me to pick up Teleport before 35F, and I would say that Teleport is the most overpowered thing among all abilities, AS LONG AS THE COORDINATES IS TYPED CORRECTLY. üòÜ</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Impressive dungeon design and gameplay system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low-budget UI and graphics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poor rock-rearrange classic music bgm</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Plat #223 - Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</p>

<p>Difficulty: 3/10</p>

<p>I‚Äôve never expected such a boring battle system in a SaGa title. Although the 3D remake enhances the narrative experience, especially those cutscenes, tremendously, the OverDrive battle system, along with the imbalanced numerics, makes the battle somehow intolerably lengthy if OD attacks are not used.</p>

<p>Besides, marking all events or quests on the world map like a to-do list makes the game less ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù on some events, such as the termites in Ostro, and the glimmering of techs is also displayed on the menu. Maybe the dev would like to reduce the complexity and clarify all the game‚Äôs mechanics to players, but the trade-off is a less enjoyable gameplay that does not encourage exploration at all.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Remaking the OG in 3D develops a better story narration, especially those cutscenes in Yauda</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Music</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poor battle system design</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much less ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù on story events</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Plat #224 - Bee Simulator</p>

<p>Difficulty: 1/10</p>

<p>How did this buggy s**t get into the PS+ Catalog?</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt buy it, and don‚Äôt even play it if you are PS+ Extra. ü§£</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Compass sometimes won‚Äôt rotate;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main camera sometimes will randomly roll left and right;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It‚Äôs an open world, but your pollen fills too soon, forcing you to go back to the hive around every 5-10 minutes;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maps are scattered in the park, but they won‚Äôt tell your current location;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The QTE battle challenges are also unbearably lengthy;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poor sound FX and audio design, though BGM sounds not bad.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Plat #225 - Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</p>

<p>Difficulty: 2/10</p>

<p>What an amazing turnabout at the end.</p>

<p>Although the world &amp; character settings look slightly too dramatic at first glance, Shu Takumi narrates in a genius way so players can accept it naturally. Some chapters are even more attractive than Gyakuten Saiban Yomigaeru Gyakuten. However, searching for a solution by interacting with all objects one by one might be frustrating without a guide.</p>

<p>For the last 5x5 sliding puzzle challenges, any puzzle solver like this may be helpful.</p>
