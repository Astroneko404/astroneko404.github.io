## #231 - Monster Hunter Wilds
*Difficulty: 3/10*

The easiest Monster Hunter game I've ever played. 🤣 

MH Wilds looks like a hybrid of MH2 and MH4. I'm glad Capcom brought the climate system back, making the environmental system much more enjoyable. Villages vary in their design, clothes, and food. Fish and other creatures will switch as the season changes.

\+ The map design is not as confusing as MH World.

\+ Auto item tracking on the map.

\+ Binoculars!

\+ Tried all 4 sword weapons (GS, LS, DB and SS), the combo system is simplified a lot, and the focus mode makes it easier to hit at a specific part, especially for GS.

\- Double weapon system. The sub-weapon is not that useful.

\- Story chapters (Ch. 1-3) seem a little bit rushed. In comparison to the story chapters, the post-story part (Ch. 4-6) is more comfortable, encourages players to visit the map and collect quests.

\- No Recoil-down for bowguns.

\- UI is a little bit messy, especially the communication part. 

## #232 - Gravity Rush 2
*Difficulty: 4/10*

If you could plat this game without conceiving of throwing your controller into your trash bin, you must have evolved into an ultra-player form. Although the concept of using gravity to fly, battle, and solve puzzles may sound fun, the actual in-game control still needs polishing. Furthermore, playing time challenge stages may make you wonder if the control could be even worse. Besides, the ending chapters also look rushed and do not connect well with the previous chapters.

\+ Map design.

\+ Great music.

\- Controls for sliding and flying are simply bad.

\- For some side missions, it is hard to finish without a guide.

## #233 - Sonic Frontiers
*Difficulty: 3/10*

My friend recommended this to me and now I wanna beat him to s**t.

This game is more like a Sonic title designed in BotW style, but much more annoying with map elements and control. It seems that the dev team would rather focus on fancy visual effects instead of polishing the control and player experience.

\+ BGMs, especially those from Cyber Space stages, are energetic.

\+ Cyber Space stages are fun to play.

\- Camera. It automatically switches to different angles, making jumps hard to control.

\- Sometimes, when characters are talking, you are not capable of moving Sonic.

\- Story boss battles and guardian boss battles are tedious, and there's no final boss.

\- Pinball.

## #234 - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection
*Difficulty: 4/10* 

Not an FTG lover, but overall, the collection looks nice, especially those arcade titles which are not only graphically aesthetic but also fun to play, although not having an HP bar for enemies might be confusing since I've already gotten used to Capcom's beat'em up titles.

As for those NES ones and GB ones, those are totally garbage. 🤣 Thankfully there is a watch mode to skip those.

## #235 - RoboCop: Rogue City
*Difficulty: 4/10*

What a hidden gem.

Although I've only watched the first movie, I can see many references here, such as the malfunctioning ED-209 and Murphy's family. Playing the game is like watching another movie. Besides, the linear chapters balance well between story and gameplay, smartly connecting each of them using a mission report. However, due to the lack of EXP, the game forces you to search every corner for Nukes and Stolen Wallets, and scan every object, even after finishing all sub-missions (Like Resident Evil Revelations).

\+ Story progresses smoothly.

\- No gyro to assist aiming.

\- Without EXP boost from Deduction, it is hard to obtain EXP.

## #236 - Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly
*Difficulty: 2/10*

Somehow I find this game a little bit confusing while unlocking trophies, maybe because the trophy guide is a little bit messy? Since selecting the chapter from the load menu will keep your choice from the save file, it is better to clear those miscellaneous trophies before doing the bad ending playthrough. But anyway, it is not a bad game, the pixel art is great, and the endless mode is fun to play.

\+ Pixel art and animation.

\+ Lo-fi music. (Is there an OST?)

\+ Endless mode might be the only enjoyable part to play, though an Excel table is necessary for the "50 correct drinks" trophy.

\- Can't say that the story is attractive due to the lack of a main storyline. The whole story is split into different characters' sub-stories. Some of them are connected and will affect other characters' stories, but most stories tend to narrate daily events, which might be tedious to read. 

## #237 - Kandagawa Jet Girls (AS)
*Difficulty: 2/10*

It is hard to review this game without playing the online battle, since similar to Senran Kagura PBS, the playability is focused on online battles, and the offline story part is more like a 10-hour tutorial. Glad that I only spent 90 HKD on this, and it is an easy plat.

\+ Somehow, the BGM is not bad.

\+ Jetboats are designed with a variety of stats and controls.

\+ Character models are much smoother, and it is hard to find some straight lines or low-polygons.

\- But overall, character designs are not as good as Senran Kagura or Valkyrie Drive. It is easy to find this if you have DLC characters.

\- No visual damage on character costume.

\- Water guns are reused from SKPBS, and it is hard to aim while the jetboat is automatically driving.

## #238 & #239 - Monument Valley
*Difficulty: 1/10*

Fantastic application of optical illusions in stage designs. By spinning different parts, you will change the structure of the map level, creating new possibilities for movement. Sound design is also smooth and matches the game environment. The only thing that makes me uncomfortable is that, compared to the control on smartphones, it is harder to use a controller to pinpoint the destination.

## #240 & #241 - Road 96
*Difficulty: 1/10*

Compared to other political-themed titles, such as Life Is Strange 2, I think Road 96 is much milder, not forcing or pushing a particular ideology on every player. The story is solid, offering the player freedom to choose between rebellion, voting and escaping, and the choice will affect the ending. Every main character in this game is fun to talk to, encouraging you to trigger more events and learn their stories. Highly recommended.

\+ Character story design

\+ Songs are bangers

\- Somehow, there could be more varieties of story branches
